# Starting Anew

So as I'm transitioning out of graduate school and into the hustle/ bustle of daily life, of course I promptly go on vacation.

I haven't had free time in forever. It's not going well.

Which is why I'm sitting in a coffeeshop trying to wrestle Jekyll into something resembling a website with my (extremely) rudimentary coding skills.

Bless bless.
